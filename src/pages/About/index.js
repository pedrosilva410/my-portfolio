        I always had an enormous interest in computers since a young age,
        how they worked and what could we really do with them, so when it
        was offered me a chance to study programming and business in my
        last 3 years of school I didn't had to think twice.
        <br/>
        During those 3 years I learnt a lot about programming, from pseudo
        code and little apps in pascal to a fully functional website.
        I was very happy with what I had achieved, but I wanted more...
        <br/>
        Ultimately, school ended I was a little bit lost because I didn't
        want to go to collage but I wasn't ready for a programming job yet,
        and thats when I got to know mindera, a big technology company in 
        Portugal and worldwide, they had a internship program where I would 
        learn about any area of programming I would have interest in.
        <br/>
        The program endured a year. It changed my life. I learned a lot,
        made a bunch of mistakes, but in overall I got much knowledge
        there both at programming expertise but also as a person
        and learnt that the area that I genuinely have interest 
        in is web development and design.
        <br/>
        This is it so far, let's see what the world has prepared for me...

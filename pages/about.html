				I'm guessing you wanted to know more...

			<p class="about__text">
				I've been fascinated by computers from a young age—how they work and
				what we can truly create with them. So, when I had the opportunity to
				study programming and business during my final three years of school,
				I didn’t have to think twice.
			</p>

			<p class="about__text">
				Throughout those three years, I learned a lot about programming,
				starting with pseudocode and small Pascal apps, eventually building a
				fully functional website. I was proud of what I had accomplished, but
				I knew I wanted more.
			</p>

			<p class="about__text">
				When school ended, I felt a bit lost. I knew I didn’t want to go to
				college, but I also wasn’t ready for a programming job yet. That’s
				when I discovered Mindera, a major technology company in Portugal and
				beyond. They offered an internship program where I could explore any
				programming field that interested me.
			</p>

			<p class="about__text">
				The program lasted a year—and it changed my life. I made plenty of
				mistakes, but I also gained invaluable knowledge, both technically and
				personally. It was there that I realized my true passion lies in web
				development and design.
			</p>

			<p class="about__text">
				This is my journey so far. Let’s see what the future holds!
